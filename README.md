  This page is my Github page for Arduino Lab in the Software Project II (소프트웨어프로젝트II) curriculum.
Arduino is a physical software computing platform that utilizes the C++ language in order to interact with
the connected device, external circuits, and so on. 
  During this semester, we will learn about all aspects of creating an Arduino-based Ball and Beam Control System,
which includes electrical + physical engineering, circuits, Arduino programming, and trial & error.
